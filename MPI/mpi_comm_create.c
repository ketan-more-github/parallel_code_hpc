/**
 * @brief Illustrates how to create a communicator.
 * @details This code extracts the group of processes in the default
 * communicator, then it keeps only the first 2 processes and creates a group
 * containing only these two. Finally, it creates a communicator based on that
 * group of 2, and proceeds to two broadcasts: one in the global communicator,
 * one in the communicator just created.
 * This application is meant to be run with at least 3 processes.
